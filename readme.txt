Quick Proto - a free Android app to create quick-and-dirty UI prototypes
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dobrien.quickproto

You can view this prototype in any web browser:
1. Unzip it (if you haven't already) into its own folder.
2. Open the HTML file that starts with "1" (for example, "1 untitled.html").
3. To view other pages, tap the links in the prototype (if any).
4. If the pages are not linked, you can just open each HTML file individually.

============
If you've created links BETWEEN different prototypes, make sure that you unzip the files so that the various project-name folders are all in the same parent folder, like this:

my prototypes
	prototype 1
		(HTML and PNG files for this prototype)
	prototype 2
		(HTML and PNG files for this prototype)

More details:

Suppose you have prototypes named "prototype 1" and "prototype 2".

When you generate HTML for each of these, you'll get two zip files, each with a timestamp on it, similar to this:
	prototype 1 - 2015-11-24  8.22PM.zip
	prototype 2 - 2015-11-22  7.12AM.zip

When you unzip these files, each will give you a folder named after the project (but without the timestamp), like this:
	prototype 1
	prototype 2

For cross-prototype links to work, these two project-name folders should live in the same parent folder. (It doesn't matter what you name the parent folder.)

For example, if you've created a "my prototypes" folder to hold all your generated prototypes, the file structure should look like the example given at the top of this file.
